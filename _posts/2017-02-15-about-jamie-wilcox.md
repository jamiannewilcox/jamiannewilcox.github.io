I am an instructional designer with an engineering and science background. I am passionate about pedagogy and online education, and have experience in teaching, instructional design, and content development. I am currently a PhD candidate at the University of California, Santa Barbara, where I investigate motor protein behavior using an optical trap (I use a high-power laser as a tractor beam to study forces within cells). In my free time I love to make things, including a hydraulic bicycle, educational puzzles, and handspun yarn.

### Teaching

Education is the key to maintaining a vibrant, complex, and equitable society. Today's technologies are producing marvelous tools for teaching and learning, which will drastically improve education when used appropriately. I am working to pave the way toward this educational revolution by combining new technologies with learning strategies that have been proven through research to be most efficient and effective.
	
I am extremely excited to utilize online education and flipped learning to replace repetitive and inefficient lecturing with in-class, teacher-guided problem solving.
	
I have a particular interest in teaching advanced science and engineering topics to high school aged, college aged, and adult learners. My mission is to provide both high quality content as well as tools for students to empower them to control their learning. I want to show students intuitive explanations of how the world works, as well as how to utilize research-proven techniques for learning and remembering more efficiently, so that they will be able to connect new information to their lives, and acquire new information in situations where teachers and textbooks are not available.

#### Experience

- Designed and taught a course on rational thinking
- Teaching assistant for 7 engineering classes at UC Santa Barbara
- Lead TA for the Mechanical Engineering Department at UCSB
- Created a video for the 2016 Khan Academy Talent Search
- Attended 20 education workshops and have invested significant personal study on research-backed education techniques
- Led 5 meetings for UCSB students and instructors to share and discuss education topics and experience

### Engineering

I love to build things and understand how things work. I received my Bachelor of Mechanical Engineering degree at the University of Minnesota in Minneapolis in May of 2012, and I am now working on a PhD in Mechanical Engineering at the University of California at Santa Barbara. 
	
During my time as an engineer I built a rainwater harvesting system in Guatemala with Engineers Without Borders, and an award-winning hydraulic bicycle for the Parker Chainless Challenge (second place overall out of twelve teams, first place for efficiency and marketability). During my PhD I have expanded, maintained, and operated a complex optical trapping system.
	
At U.C. Santa Barbara I have been a Teaching Assistant for seven engineering classes, my favorites being Computer Aided Machining and Control System Design. I love to design and teach lessons where students can create, take things apart, make predictions, and test them out. I guide my students to connect what they're learning to the broader picture, and to understand the basic underlying principles at work.
	
#### Experience

- Programming: MATLAB, LabVIEW, C++, LaTeX, Arduino, Python, G-Code
- Engineering software: Pro/ENGINEER, Autodesk Inventor, AutoCAD, FlashCut CNC, grbl, CorelDRAW
- Designed and taught a class session on ethical considerations in automation
- Taught lab sessions on computer-aided milling and routing, laser cutting, and 3D printing
- Was a teaching assistant for classes on mechanical engineering design, control system design, molecular and cellular biomechanics, and computer-aided machining
	
### Science

In my PhD research I use an optical trap (a tightly-focused laser that acts like a tiny tractor beam) to measure the force applied by motor proteins (machines that move cargo around your cells).
	
As a scientist, sharing my research and knowledge is one of the most important parts of my job. At UCSB I have given over fifty technical presentations. I have mentored undergraduate students in the lab, and I have volunteered at science outreach events.
	
I designed and taught a course for high schoolers where I covered topics on rational thinking, including memories, cognitive biases, and designing experiments. I want to share the scientific method with the world, and to help people use the tools of rationality to make decisions that will have the outcomes they want. 
	
#### Experience

- Demonstrated polymerization at NanoDays
- Mentored undergraduate students 
- Maintained, expanded, and operated the complex optics and electronics of an optical trap
- Analyzed data in MATLAB
- Designed and managed experiments and projects
