## The School for Scientific Thought

I designed and taught this course for the [School for Scientific Thought](http://sst-csep.cnsi.ucsb.edu/) (SST) program at UCSB. 

The purpose of the SST program is to engage high school students in a specialized science topic that isn't covered in school, while also introducing the students to a university setting and to scientist and engineer role models. Graduate students instructors design and teach courses in which they have particular expertise. The program runs for five consecutive weekends, with one two-hour session each week.

## Rational Thinking

I chose to explore the topic of rational thinking with the central question, "how do our brains trick us?" 

Rational thinking is a crucial scientific ability that is often touched on in science classes, but is rarely covered in depth. Skills such as interpreting data, designing experiments, and understanding how our brains can trick us, are typically left for budding scientists to “learn by osmosis,” even though reliable research hinges on them. Since many SST students have plans to pursue higher education in science and engineering, I felt that these skills would give them ... These skills are also valuable for better decision making in everyday life. 

My main goal for the course was to show students the ways in which our brains can mislead us, and to emphasize that human brains do not think rationally by default.

Course topics included
- Memories
- Cognitive biases
- Interpreting data
- Troubleshooting and the scientific method
- Designing experiments

## Overcoming Instructional Challenges

The SST program does not include exams or homework, which makes sense for the nature of the course and the relatively short time frame. However, this makes assessing the accomplishment of learning objectives less straightforward. 

To overcome this challenge, I experimented with "minute papers", an activity where the instructor posts two to three classes in the last few minutes of class and the students write their responses. Minute paper questions are usually fairly open ended, for example "what do you think the main point of today's lesson was?" or "what was the most confusing topic? Did it get cleared up, or are you still confused?"

The minute papers turned out to be a great way to assess whether the students were following the course. For the most part, they indicated that students were getting the main points of the sessions.

## Demystifying abstract concepts with concrete activities

I attempted to make the class as active as possible by designing activities for students to both explore new topics and practice what they had learned. Whenever possible I designed activities for students to explore a new topic on their own.

My most successful lessons were
- The Anti-Debate
- Mystery Tubes
- Law of Small Numbers


## Lessons learned

This was my first time teaching a large group of high schoolers, and I learned a great deal about classroom management. 

I learned some tricks for getting them out of their shells

In my experience, students work best when they feel respected and like they have a hand in their learning...

The students were highly motivated, and not difficult to manage, but it was har
getting them out of their shells

The students were very inspiring to work with.

As an engineering TA, the material I teach is generally very concrete--
equations, geometry, forces and masses...

I have more ideas for active lessons...practicing identifying cognitive biases in 

If I were to teach the class again, I would like to have the students practice identifying biases in their own thinking...

At a workshop on Backward Design, I was able to get together with other instructors and think of creative ways to have students practice identifying cognitive biases in their own thinking. 


The course's short timeframe proved to be both a restriction and a liberator. Because I only had the students for five two-hour session, I really had to pare down what I wanted to teach into the most important ideas. 

Students not coming to all classes?

My first time working with high schoolers?

It's easy to be skeptical of others' assertions, but harder to be skeptical about our own thoughts.
