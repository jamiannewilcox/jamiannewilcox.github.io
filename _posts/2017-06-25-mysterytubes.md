Mystery tubes are an educational puzzle that can be used to teach troubleshooting, model building, and the scientific method.

How I learned about the mystery tube.

The best thing about this project was that I was so excited after I made the mystery tubes that for the rest of the day I ran around campus and showed them off to all my friends. It was fascinating to see the range of reactions to the tubes. I was also a little jealous, since I never had the chance to solve the tube myself! Some people gave up and peeked after a minute or two, and others persevered and tried all kinds of techniques to divine the tube's insides. I primed people by showing them three simple motions (show a gif of me doing this?) I hypothesize that priming in this way gives people misconceptions about how one is "supposed" to use the tube (e.g. pulling each string all the way instead of leaving some half pulled.)


The unexpected __ provides a sense of cognitive dissonance that makes the exercise memorable.

when I show the mystery tube, I show it the way I do in the gif, and it primes people to think that there's a certain way the tube 'should be used'

troubleshooting--subset of the scientific method
making models
I don't like to 'give the correct answer' because in science there is nobody to tell you whether your experiments are correct. You can open the mystery tube whenever you are satisfied with your explanation, hypothesis, troubleshooting methods--when you are satisfied that you have sufficiently teseted your hypothesis
The point is how you problem solve, the point is not to find the right answer, but to make a prediction and test it until you have a theory that is consistent with observation

giving students two different tubes to see if they figure out that they're different

How did the students react? Did they like the mystery tube exercies?

What were my learning objectives for the lesson

How did my colleagues react
Ways to troubleshoot--shake it, measure the cords, listen while you pull, pull two at a time and feel for vibrations
