I am an <b>instructional designer with an engineering and science background</b>. I am passionate about pedagogy, online education and education technology, and I have experience in teaching, instructional design, and content development. I am currently a PhD candidate at the University of California, Santa Barbara, where I use a high-power laser as a tractor beam to study forces within cells (I investigate motor protein behavior using an optical trap). In my free time I love to make things, including a hydraulic bicycle, educational puzzles, and handspun yarn.

### Teaching

I believe that education is the key to maintaining a vibrant, complex, and equitable society. I am passionate about combining technology with research-proven teaching and learning strategies to create high quality content and tools for students. I have particular interest and experience in teaching advanced science and engineering topics to high school, college, and adult learners.


#### Experience

- Designed and taught a course on rational thinking for high schoolers
- Designed and taught a class session on ethical considerations in automation
- Designed and taught this year's Mechanical Engineering Teaching Assistant training as Lead TA for the ME Department at UCSB
- Served as a teaching assistant for 7 engineering classes at UCSB, including mechanical engineering design, control system design, molecular and cellular biomechanics, and computer-aided machining.
- Taught labs on computer-aided milling, routing, laser cutting, and 3D printing
- Started and organized an education and pedagogy group at UCSB
- Received extensive pedagogical training through UCSB's Instructional Development department
- Created educational videos on my YouTube channel
