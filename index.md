I am a <b>data scientist with an engineering and science background</b>, and I am passionate about using data to improve lives. I am currently a Data Science Fellow at Insight Data Science, where I conceived and built <a href="http://www.knitpicker.site">KnitPicker</a>, a web app that predicts and explains the difficulty of knitting patterns on <a href="http://www.ravelry.com">ravelry.com</a>. In my free time I love to make things, including a hydraulic bicycle, 
<a href="/2017/06/25/mysterytubes"> educational puzzles</a>, and handspun yarn.

### Data Science

I am a data-driven person with a drive to use analytical tools to make the world better. I have experience in machine learning and statistical analysis.

#### Experience

- Data: Simulation, statistical analysis, data cleaning and processing, time series analysis, natural language processing.
- Programming: Python (scikit-learn, pandas, sqlite3, numpy, seaborn), MATLAB, SQL, C/C++, Git, LaTeX.
- Built data product knitpicker.site using a linear regression model and bag of words.
- Mined metadata for over 750 000 patterns from the Ravelry API and stored them in a SQLite database.



### Teaching

<!--I am passionate about pedagogy, online education and education technology, and I have experience in teaching, instructional design, and content development.-->

I believe that education is the key to maintaining a vibrant, complex, and equitable society. I am passionate about combining technology with research-proven teaching and learning strategies to create high quality content and tools for students, and I have experience in teaching, instructional design, and content development. My specialty is teaching advanced science and engineering topics to high school, college, and adult learners.


#### Experience

- Designed and taught a [course on rational thinking for high schoolers](/2017/06/10/brainhacks).
- Designed and taught a class session on ethical considerations in automation.
- Designed and taught this year's Mechanical Engineering Teaching Assistant training as Lead TA for the ME Department at UCSB.
- Served as a teaching assistant for 7 engineering classes at UCSB, including Mechanical Engineering Design, Control System Design, Molecular and Cellular Biomechanics, and Computer-Aided Machining.
- Taught labs on computer-aided milling, routing, laser cutting, and 3D printing.
- Started and organized an education and pedagogy group at UCSB.
- Received extensive pedagogical training through UCSB's Instructional Development department.
- Created educational videos on my [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WW0LlDr8mc&t=1s).
- Mentored undergraduate researchers.


### Science and Engineering

I love to build things and understand how things work. I received my Bachelor of Mechanical Engineering degree at the University of Minnesota in Minneapolis, and recently completed a [PhD in Mechanical Engineering at UCSB](https://www.osapublishing.org/ol/abstract.cfm?uri=ol-41-10-2386) where I used a high-power laser as a tractor beam to study forces within cells (I developed optical trapping technologies to measure the forces of motor proteins).
	
#### Experience

- Programming: MATLAB, python, LabVIEW, Arduino, G-Code.
- Engineering software: Autodesk Inventor, AutoCAD, Pro/ENGINEER, FlashCut CNC, grbl, CorelDRAW.
- Upgraded, operated, and maintained the complex optics and electronics of an optical trap.
- Built a rainwater harvesting system in Guatemala with Engineers Without Borders.
- Built an award-winning hydraulic bicycle for the Parker Chainless Challenge (second place overall out of twelve teams and first place for efficiency).
- Extensive experience with data analysis and simulations in MATLAB.
- Designed and managed biophysics experiments.
