I am an <b>instructional designer with an engineering and science background</b>. I am passionate about pedagogy, online education and education technology, and I have experience in teaching, instructional design, and content development. I recently completed my PhD at the University of California, Santa Barbara, where I used a high-power laser as a tractor beam to study forces within cells (I developed optical trapping technologies to measure the forces of motor proteins). In my free time I love to make things, including a hydraulic bicycle,

### Teaching

I believe that education is the key to maintaining a vibrant, complex, and equitable society. I am passionate about combining technology with research-proven teaching and learning strategies to create high quality content and tools for students. I have particular interest and experience in teaching advanced science and engineering topics to high school, college, and adult learners.
