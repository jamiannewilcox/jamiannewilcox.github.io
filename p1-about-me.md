I am an <b>instructional designer with an engineering and science background</b>. I am passionate about pedagogy, online education and education technology, and I have experience in teaching, instructional design, and content development. I am currently a PhD candidate at the University of California, Santa Barbara, where I use a high-power laser as a tractor beam to study forces within cells (I investigate motor protein behavior using an optical trap). In my free time I love to make things, including a hydraulic bicycle, educational puzzles, and handspun yarn.

### Teaching

I believe that education is the key to maintaining a vibrant, complex, and equitable society. Today's technologies are producing marvelous tools for teaching and learning, which will drastically improve education when used appropriately. I am working to pave the way toward this educational revolution by combining new technologies with research-proven learning strategies.

I am extremely excited to utilize online education and flipped learning to replace repetitive and inefficient lecturing with in-class, teacher-guided problem solving.

I have a particular interest in teaching advanced science and engineering topics to high school, college, and adult learners. My mission is to provide both high quality content as well as tools that empower students to control their own learning. I want to show students intuitive explanations of how the world works, as well as how to utilize research-proven techniques for learning and remembering more efficiently. I want students be able to connect new information to their lives and acquire new information in situations where teachers and textbooks are not available.

#### Experience

- Designed and taught a course on rational thinking for high schoolers
- Teaching assistant for 7 engineering classes at UC Santa Barbara
- Lead TA for the Mechanical Engineering Department at UCSB
- Started and organized an education and pedagogy group for UCSB teaching assistants and instructors to share and discuss education topics and experience
- Have received extensive training through UCSB's Instructional Development program
in addition to significant personal study on research-backed education techniques
- Participated in the 2016 Khan Academy Talent Search

### Engineering

I love to build things and understand how things work. I received my Bachelor of Mechanical Engineering degree at the University of Minnesota in Minneapolis in May of 2012, and I am now working on a PhD in Mechanical Engineering at UCSB.
	
During my time at the University of Minnesota I built a rainwater harvesting system in Guatemala with Engineers Without Borders and an award-winning hydraulic bicycle for the Parker Chainless Challenge (we received second place overall out of twelve teams and first place for efficiency). At UCSB I have upgraded, maintained, and operated a complex optical trapping system.
	
At UCSB I have been a Teaching Assistant for seven engineering classes, my favorites being Computer Aided Machining and Control System Design. I love to design and teach lessons where students can create, take things apart, make predictions, and test them out. I guide my students to connect what they're learning to the broader picture, and to understand the basic underlying principles at work.
	
#### Experience

- Programming: MATLAB, LabVIEW, C++, LaTeX, Arduino, Python, G-Code
- Engineering software: Pro/ENGINEER, Autodesk Inventor, AutoCAD, FlashCut CNC, grbl, CorelDRAW
- Designed and taught a class session on ethical considerations in automation
- Taught lab sessions on computer-aided milling and routing, laser cutting, and 3D printing
- Was a teaching assistant for classes on mechanical engineering design, control system design, molecular and cellular biomechanics, and computer-aided machining
- Maintained, upgraded, and operated the complex optics and electronics of an optical trap
    
### Science

In my PhD research I use an optical trap (a tightly-focused laser that acts like a tiny tractor beam) to measure the force applied by motor proteins (machines that move cargo around your cells).
	
As a scientist, sharing my research and knowledge is one of the most important parts of my job. At UCSB I have given over fifty technical presentations. I have mentored undergraduate students in the lab, and I have volunteered at science outreach events.
	
I designed and taught a course for high schoolers where I covered topics on rational thinking, including memories, cognitive biases, and designing experiments. I want to share the scientific method with the world, and to help people use the tools of rationality to make decisions that will have the outcomes they want. 
	
#### Experience

- Designed and managed experiments and projects
- Mentored undergraduate researchers 
- Extensive experience with technical presentations
- Extensive experience with data analysis and simulations in MATLAB
